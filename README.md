# CHSH Nonlocality Measures for Two-Qubit States

This repository contains Python code to compute various geometric and entropic measures of CHSH nonlocality for two-qubit states, including Werner and Bell-diagonal states.

## Files

- `measures.py` : Contains all functions to compute Hilbert-Schmidt, Hellinger, Trace, and Relative Entropy nonlocality measures.
- `main_nonlocality_measures.py` : Example script to generate plots and compute the measures using `measures.py`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
